Title: "Munch"
---
"Munch is the character manifestation of the heart of Oddworld. He is the character that best illustrates the desire to tug at the heartstrings of the audience. From his big dewey eyes to his lonely cal for his brothers that will never respond, Munch makes you want to fight for him every step of the way" - The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants, 1999

Munch is the last known [Gabbit](/species/gabbit) in (Oddworld).
Munch was captured by the sadistic [Vykkers](/species/Vykkers)by getting his leg caught in a [Scrab](/species/scrab) trap to be used as a test subject and harvest his lungs for [Lady Margaret](/characers/ladymargaret).
One of the tests included inplanting a sonar device in his skull which is designed to detect and disarm traps.
Munch can fire a powerful discharge of electricity from this sonar which is strong enough to stun enemies through use of the [Zap Vending Machine](/items/zapvendingmachine).
The device can also be used to free the [Fuzzle](/species/fuzzle) test subjects from their cages, who also took part in aiding Munch from escaping [Vykkers Labs](/locations/vykkerslabs) to meet with [Abe](/characters/abe) who he journeys with to seek out [The Almighty Raisin](/characters/thealmightyraisin) who tells them to acomplish their goals, it is Munch's  dream to bring back his species from the brink of extinction.

# Appearance
>Munch is a small greyish purple amphibian like creature known as a [Gabbit](/species/gabbit),
He is short in stature with a large shark-like head, this element would play with your expectations when you first see his head skimming the furace of the water. You may thinka shark-like creature may be approaching then in a suprise reveal... You meet Munch!
>Munch has a broken single fin like leg which helps him swim at high speeds in large bodies of water, but this also causes his mobility to be hindered on land forcing him to use a wheelchair. Everything about Munch's appearence reinforces his plight to return fo the open waters that are his true home.

# Personality
Munch is a little freedom fighter, he does not talk much but his voice is croaked and does not speak words as fast as other species. Munch is the kind of creature to put his life in danger to save those in need
