  ## Description

  **RuptureFarms 1029** is a central location of [Abe's Oddysee](/games/abes_oddysee). It is a gigantic meat-packing plant, housing a hundred (three hundred and one in New 'n' Tasty) Mudokons and several dozen Sligs, along with the facility's board of directors, a group of [Glukkons](/species/glukkon), headed by [Molluck](/characters/molluck), who is the son of [Lady Margaret](/characters/lady_margaret), current interim head of the [Magog Cartel](/concepts/magog_cartel).

  ## Appearance

  ### Abe's Oddysee

  RuptureFarms in Abe's Oddysee is a decrepit looking, run down factory, surrounded by gigantic smokestacks that belch smoke, dimming the sky above.

  ### New 'n' Tasty

  Unlike in Abe's Oddysee, the RuptureFarms of New 'n' Tasty is an almost futuristic looking building featuring huge neon lights and a much sleeker design.

  ### Soulstorm

  On a piece of promotional material, we can see the outskirts on which RuptureFarms is built, along with the smouldering remains of the facility. Notably, unlike in Abe's Oddysee, RuptureFarms is surrounded by an uninhabited prairie, instead of a complex network of buildings.

  ## Fate

  Depending on Abe's choices, RuptureFarms is eventually destroyed a mythical storm, caused by a team of Mudokons, who activate a device called the Rainmaker. The wild lightnings that incapacitate Molluck and kill his Slig aide, also caused a fire inside the facility, which being largely deserted and cut-off power burned down.
