*"You just gotta jump in!"* - Alf

The Big Well is a natural landmark located in North-west Mudos that can be found in [Munches Oddysee](/games/munchesoddysee).

When Abe and his friends find the well by [The Mighy Raisin](/characters/themightyraisen)s instructions, Abe is reluctant to jump in saying
"Isn't that way too high?" while pointing up to a passing by [Vykkers Lab](/locations/vykkerslab)s and then saying "That's a kinda scary well" while the camera pans over the extraordinarily large opening.

The Big Well appears to be a massive geyser that fires anything that go in, back out at incredible speed, 
this incredible launching speed is what allows Abe (temporary) access to Vykkers labs via the labs open bottom.

The Big Well design seems to have been decided very earily on as no concept art or alter designs are known at the time of writing.
